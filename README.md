# Simple Affiliate Disclosures for WordPress 

A simple one-file WordPress plugin that allows you to create a custom disclosure (or any kind of notice) that you wish to show at the beginning of posts.

No bloat, no crazy admin interfaces. 

## Installing

1. Add the plugin as you normall would.
2. Look under Settings -> Disclosures 
3. Set your custom disclosure / message (inc any HTML you want to use).
4. Select what categories you want the disclosure to show on (or leave to show on all)
5. Save


## Extending / Customising

There are a bunch of easy extensions that could be made, including custom post types, custom taxonomies, and custom position of the disclosures. Feel free to submit pull requests.
